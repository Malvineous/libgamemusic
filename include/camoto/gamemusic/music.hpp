	 * When type is:
	 *
	 * - AnyChannel: this value is 0-255.  The value
	 *   is not so important, but only one note can be played on each channel
	 *   at a time, across all tracks.  It is not valid to write any tracks
	 *   with this channel type set.  All AnyChannel tracks must be mapped to
	 *   other values before a song is passed to a format writer.  This is to
	 *   prevent every format writer from having to map channels itself.
	 *   @todo: Make a utility function to do this.
	 *
	 * - OPLChannel: this value is 0 to 8 for normal OPL channels on
	 *   chip 1, and 9 to 17 for chip 2.  Some events are global and will affect
	 *   the whole chip regardless of what track they are played on.
	 *
	 * - OPLPercChannel: this value is 4 for bass drum, 3 for snare, 2 for tomtom,
	 *   1 for top cymbal, 0 for hi-hat.  Other values are invalid.
	 *
	 * - MIDIChannel: this value is 0 to 15, with 9 being percussion.
	 *
	 * - PCMChannel: this value is the channel index starting at 0.  For some
	 *   formats like .mod, this affects the panning of the channel.
	 *
	 * Note that OPL percussion mode uses channels 6, 7 and 8, so it is not
	 * valid for a song to have OPLChannel events on these channels while
	 * OPLPercChannel events are present.  This may happen temporarily during a
	 * format conversion, but this state must be resolved by the time the
	 * data is written out to a file.
