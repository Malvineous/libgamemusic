 * @param output
 *   The output stream.  MIDI data is written at the current seek pointer, which
 *   need not be at the beginning of the file.
 *
 * @param music
 *   Song to write out as MIDI data.
 *
 * @param midiFlags
 *   One or more flags.  Use MIDIFlags::Default unless the MIDI
 *   data is unusual in some way.
 *
 * @param channelsUsed
 *   Pointer to an array of MIDI_CHANNEL_COUNT entries of bool.  On return, this each
 *   entry is set to true where that MIDI channel was used.  Set to NULL if this
 *   information is not required.
 *
 * @param eventOrder
 *   Flag to indicate the order of event processing.
 *   EventHandler::Order_Row_Track will produce a single stream of MIDI events
 *   suitable for a type-0 MIDI file (where cbEndOfTrack could be NULL) while
 *   EventHandler::Order_Track_Row will produce multiple streams of MIDI events
 *   split up by libgamemusic tracks, with cbEndOfTrack called at the end of
 *   each libgamemusic track - more suited to type-1 MIDI files.
 *
 * @param cbEndOfTrack
 *   Callback notified at the end of each track.  May be NULL.
