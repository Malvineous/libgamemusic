/**
 * All MIDI files have at least one track, but some have additional tracks
 * with events to be played concurrently.  Each channel within each track
 * is assigned to a unique libgamemusic channel, i.e. events for MIDI
 * channel 5 on track 1 might be returned as channel 0, and events for
 * the same channel 5 on track 2 could be returned as channel 1.
 *
 * The MIDI data will be read from input until either EOF or an end-of-track
 * event is encountered.  If there is a possibility of non-MIDI data following
 * the MIDI data, a substream should be used to prevent the non-MIDI data from
 * being processed.
 *
 * @param input
 *   Data stream containing the MIDI data.
 *
 * @param flags
 *   One or more flags.  Use MIDIFlags::Default unless the MIDI
 *   data is unusual in some way.
 *
 * @param initialTempo
 *   Initial tempo of the song.  The number of ticks in a quarter note is
 *   particularly important for a MIDI file to get the beat/bar arrangement
 *   correct.
